# From Leaders to Parents
## Scoutbook
In my experience scoutbook has been terribly frustrating as a means of communication. It mostly doesn't work, and when it does, it gets caught by spam filters or out of date email addresses. It almost always works better to simply ignore it, and use email.

## Email
Email is almost always the best form of communication. It allows for a paragraph or two of coordination, and links, as well as the use of templates (see the activites page).

## Text
Text other leaders, but it's probably best to not text an adult unless they initiate.

## Brookwood Newsletter
Mr. Frick sends out a newsletter each week and it gets read by many parents. It's not too hard to ask for an upcoming activity to be added to the bottom of the newsletter, work with the front desk to get a notice in the newsletter. This works best for activities that the public is invited to.
