## Recycled Raingutter Regatta Rules
**RULES:**

- Cub Scouts must make their own boats. However, parental advice is welcome.
- Hull, mast, and sail must be made from recycled materials-get creative!
- Tape, glue, putty, Play-Doh, and hot glue are approved materials for binding boat parts together.
- Boats must be **less than 3 inches wide, less than 8 inches long, and less than 7 inches high.**
- All boys will use a straw provided by the pack at the race to blow his sailboat down the track. (We may use Water guns or fans to blow them this year).
- NO HANDS may touch the boat during the race, except to right a sunken or tipped boat.

**SUGGESTIONS FOR RECYCLE REGATTA MATERIALS**
* **Hulls:** juice boxes, slabs of foam insulation, 8-ounce water bottles, soda bottles, Capri Sun pouches, Popsicle sticks (to create a raft design).
* **Masts:** straws, skewers, small dowels, pencils.
* **Sails:** construction paper, index cards, cut-up cereal boxes, small chip bags, Capri Sun pouches.
* But not so much these: newsprint and other materials that can get waterlogged, and thick pieces of foam, which stick to the gutters and make a mess when broken.

**There will be prizes for fastest boat and most creative designs in each den!**
