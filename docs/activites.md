This is a great get-together really any sunny day. The kids will almost certainly catch fish, and there's lot of fun to be had learning about our environment. Worms can be purchased from

Hello all!

To capitalize on the decent weather, we would like to get the scouts together at Meadowbrook Park to briefly talk about the local fish, basic regulations, and catch a few fish.  We will have a few extra poles and basic tackle set up with bobbers and worms for anyone willing to learn and/or join.  Last week we were able to have fun catching a lot of little fish. This should also count towards the requirement, "A Bear Goes Fishing".

# Hike in SM Environment Science Lab

| :warning: | Requires coordination with SMSD staff to unlock the gate. |

At the corner of 107th and Nall there's a large wild area that's managed by the school district. It can be toured (there's some basic trails in it) if you can coordinate with a staff member at Shawnee Mission South. A bunch of deer live in there, and there's a pond as well. If you take gear to pick up trash you can probably fill a few bags. Your feet will likely get muddy if it's wet out. It's fenced all the way around.

Hi Scout Parents!

For this month we've planned a hike around a particularly wild area nearby, with the scouts picking up trash along the way, and hopefully spotting some wildlife (I've seen a nest of bald eagles nearby, and plenty of deer).

We'll hike at the Shawnee Mission Environmental Science Lab, a wild area to the east of SM South High. Links below to the parking lot we'll meet in, it's L shaped. The gate to get in the ESL is right across from it.

Bring some trash bags or grabbers if you have them.
This will help complete Bear requirements: (Fur, Feathers, and Ferns), and (Fellowship and Duty to God)
